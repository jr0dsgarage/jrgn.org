## Let's get this started for a second time!

I managed to squash the first attempt at creating this hugo website by clobbering the files I'd edited using github.  I would still call myself a github novice, and sometimes it shows.  

Hopefully this time there's less mess.  I have started out correctly by getting all the github repository links set up before making any changes, so that I can commit changes as I make them now, as intended.

The bit that threw me off is the workflow of doing a `git init` in a newly created hugo site, editing files, and then pushing those files onto the main branch of a brand new github repository.  Whatever I did, all my edited files and new posts went missing from the source files.  I still had the generated website running here, but no longer had the files I'd used to generate the site! ðŸ¤”

I felt a little ill after it happened, and set the hugo site aside for a week, and am now making another attempt at establishing this home for my garage network homelab.  I have lots of fun ideas that I'd like to share, and have always wanted to host my own media, to be linked to from the popular social medias.
